                Methane is a flammable gas formed by geological and biological 
                processes. Some of the natural ones are leaks from natural gas 
                systems and wetlands.
                50-65% of total global methane emissions come from human 
                activities. These include livestock, agriculture, oil and 
                gas systems, waste from homes and businesses, landfills, 
                and so on.

                Methane is a gas with a global warming potential several 
                times stronger than of CO2. For more than 650,000 years,
                methane concentration in the atmosphere was between 350 
                â€“ 800 ppb. From the beginning of the industrial revolution, 
                human activities have increased this amount by around 150%.
