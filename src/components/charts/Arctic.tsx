                    The arctic is warming around twice as fast as global average. 
                    Some of the reasons for this are: The arctic amplification, 
                    the albedo effect, and black carbon. From 1979 to 1996, we lost 2.2 â€“ 3% 
                    of the arctic ice cover. From 2010 to present we are losing 12.85% per decade!

                    Another consequence is permafrost thawing. 
                    This is a process in which large amounts of methane is released to the 
                    atmosphere, fueling more the process of global warming.
